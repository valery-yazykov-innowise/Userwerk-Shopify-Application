### 2. Preparing the environment to start a project
Go to the folder where docker-compose.yml stores and run "docker-compose up", then go inside www/ and run "composer install". After that all dependencies will be created.

Next you need to run ngrok - "ngrok http 8080".

You need to change the .env.example file. To change the name, run the command - "mv .env.example .env" and open this file "sudo nano .env".

Environment Example:
```dotenv
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=211kn41j5as8f12hnb5j12b5h14v
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=j1g41jf78as7n81mnca87f5an2
SHOPIFY_APP_SCOPES=write_script_tags,read_script_tags

STORE_NAME=https://test.myshopify.com
API_VERSION=2023-01
FILE_NAME=shopify-token.txt
```

You need to change 4 values: SHOPIFY_API_KEY, SHOPIFY_API_SECRET, SHOPIFY_APP_HOST_NAME, STORE_NAME.

- SHOPIFY_API_KEY = Partners Shopify -> Apps -> Your App -> Overview -> Client ID.
- SHOPIFY_API_SECRET = Partners Shopify -> Apps -> Your App -> Overview -> Client Secret. 
- SHOPIFY_APP_HOST_NAME = Ngrok -> Forwarding -> First Value.
- STORE_NAME = Shopify Admin -> Settings.

Save this file and exit - "ctrl + o" + "ctrl + z".

Next you need to go to the docker container - "docker exec -it php-apache bash".
After these steps, enter this command and give permission to modify files - "chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/".
Then write "exit" and exit from container.

### 3. Changing fields in Shopify Partners app settings

After these steps, you need to fill in the required fields in App Setup (Shopify Partners). To do this, go to your app settings (Shopify Partners -> Apps -> Your App -> App Setup -> URLs).

Example fields in App Setup:

```
App URL = https://40-31v1-148-2509.eu.ngrok.io
Allowed Redirection URL(s) = https://40-31v1-148-2509.eu.ngrok.io/hookcallback.php
                             https://40-31v1-148-2509.eu.ngrok.io/authcallback.php
```

- App URL = Ngrok -> Forwarding -> First Value.
- Allowed Redirection URL(s) = Ngrok -> Forwarding -> First Value /hookcallback.php and Ngrok -> Forwarding -> First Value /authcallback.php.


After host your plugin or run ngrok don't forget change URLs.
